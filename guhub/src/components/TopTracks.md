10. Luminiscent Creatures - Ichiko Aoba
This was perhaps the first new album I listened to this year. I'm not hugely into Japanese music, so this was a great change of pace. Overall, I thought it did the slow relaxed ocassionally intense vibes really well! IMO not much to say other than that, but I liked it a lot!

9. Getting Killed - Geese
I feel there's always a competition between pretentious people trying to remake older music and pretentious people makign overproduced 21st century glitch-slop. I'm usually a huge proponent of the latter (for example, I despised Geordie Greep while glazing tf out of Imaginal Disk). Though I have glitch-slop above this album later on in this list, Geese did a great job with this album that I was so reluctant to like. Everyone IK was going crazy about this, so I went in with a closed mind and still liked it quite a bit which is a testament to its quality.

8. Apiary - Gingerbee

Some sort of midwest emo mixed with samba and screamo. I really like the way they combine screaming with 8-bit and jazz. Only criticism is how boring some of the songs get and that it's also relatively short. Still great!

7. Ghostholding - Venturing
Didn’t think I’d have the same artist on here twice (spoiler alert). This is Jane remover’s other project which i was extremely fond of. I didn’t realize how much I liked her voice when it’s not beinf distorted like crazy. Though this album has nothing novel about it, I overall think this is one of my favorite minimalist albums to date as I’m usually such a huge fan of overproduction.

6. K1- Kmoe
nother spoiler- the next 3 artists are extremely similar, but I guess that’s just where my taste is this year. KMOE is a  relatively new artist & I love his whiny ass voice. Idk overall the pros and distortion in general is awesome though not super original. He sounds great!

5. Revengeseekerz- Jane remover
I was CONFIDENT this would be my AOTY when i was listening to it when it came out. It’s genuinely insane how good this album is & it’s prolly her best. JRJRJR is lowkey one of the best rage songs ever made icel.

4. Vanisher, horizon scraper 
Lowkey feel gross liking ts cus Quadeca is goated but popular amongst smellier folks. I was so ready to dislike this album when it came out but MAN Quadeca is on a crazy run. Scrapyard was good but this album is insane. Good for him.

3. I love my computer- ninajirachi
Hooooooooly peak this album is so so good thank u for the put on William 1!1! This album is sosososososos good and some of the best prod I’ve seen in a while. Nina is locked tf in and I genuinely think she has the potential to make a crazy t10 album in the future. All of this is coming from someone who also didn’t even listen to the album more than maybe 3x lmao

2. Cowards - Squid


This album is lowk the only one here that isn't rated crazily on RYM & i'm not too sure why. I found this album from an instagram reel unrelated to music (it was just using a song from the album in the background) and checked it out. What you need to take away from this ranking is
Squid > Geese > Swans
I love the lead singers voice soooo much and overall it's just such an interesting sound & concept.
